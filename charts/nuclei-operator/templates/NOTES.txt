The nuclei-operator is now watching for Ingress and VirtualService resources.

To create a NucleiScan manually, you can apply a resource like:

  apiVersion: nuclei.homelab.mortenolsen.pro/v1alpha1
  kind: NucleiScan
  metadata:
    name: example-scan
  spec:
    sourceRef:
      apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
      kind: Ingress
      name: my-ingress
      namespace: default
      uid: <ingress-uid>
    targets:
      - https://example.com

To view scan results:

  $ kubectl get nucleiscans -A
  $ kubectl describe nucleiscan <scan-name>

{{- if .Values.metrics.enabled }}

Metrics are enabled. The metrics service is available at:
  {{ include "nuclei-operator.fullname" . }}-metrics-service:{{ .Values.metrics.service.port }}
